<h1>Background to Know</h1>
<p>Definition and Impact</p>

<aside class="notes">
According to the NIEHS, a pesticide is “any substance used to kill, repel, or control certain forms of plant or animal life that are considered to be pests.” These include herbicides, insecticides, fungicides, and disinfectants. Pesticides are an issue because of their harmful (toxic) effects on the environment and on animal life (including humans). Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring” alerted the world of the harmful effects of pesticides.

<h1>Environmental Impact</h1>

<aside class="notes">
As mentioned in the previous slide, pesticides pose a potentially detrimental consequence on the environment. Concerning humans, according to the NIEHS, evidence suggests that children who have been exposed to pesticides have been linked to neurodevelopmental issues. Farmers who use the harmful chemicals experienced an increase in headaches, fatigue, insomnia, dizziness, hand tremors, and other neurological symptoms.

<h1>Implemented Regulations</h1>

<aside class="notes">
According to the EPA’s website, there are many rules and regulations that apply when using pesticides. This is especially true to farmers who bring their products to the public for sale. These products are to be labeled. The United States have also banned many of the extremely harmful pesticides. A more complete list can be found here: http://scorecard.goodguide.com/chemical-groups/one-list.tcl?short_list_name=brpest All sales of pesticides must come with proper registration and license, and each chemical that is sold must be accounted for and be under the acceptable pesticides to be used for the intent.

<aside class="notes">
<p>At best, these regulations thus far have only “minorly” slowed our destruction of our habitats. Runoff is still poisoning streams, and many species suffer. Pesticides aren’t banned, and it doesn’t make sense. A little realized fact is that “pesticides are the only toxic substances released intentionally into our environment to kill living things,” accoriding to the Toxic Action Center. If we’ve banned so many chemicals in the past because they are harmful to wildlife, why do we intentionally use a killer toxin to do the job? &lt;&gt;</p>

<h1>Implemented Solutions</h1>
<p><img src="http://landscapemanagement.net/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Robertson-blog-300x182.jpg"  height="364" width="600"></p>
<aside class="notes">
Well, the problem that presents itself to us is that we are dependent on these chemicals because they keep our foods safe from pests, so that they can grow. A solution that has been used now to break ourselves from this dependence is bees. That’s right. Bees are the natural and harmless pollinators of the world. Another method that is beginning to be used is IPM. The Texas Pest Management Association says IPM is “A sustainable approach to managing pests by combining the use of all practical methods of pest control including biological, cultural, physical, and chemical methods, in a manner that attains the clients' goals while minimizing economic, health, and environmental risks.“ IPM is aimed at minimizing or optimizing the use of high risk pesticides; IPM is not organic farming.<br />

<h1>IPM</h1>
<p><img src="http://www.aspenpitkin.com/Portals/0/images/pesticides%20Integrated%20Pest%20Management.jpg"  height="350" width="350"></p>
<aside class="notes">
IPM has proved since around 1972 to be an extremely useful and successful tool. Still, it involves some use of pesticides when necessary. This reverts back to my earlier point that we are still using them, so we are still risking ruining waterways by runoff. We shouldn’t be okay with damaging our planet and its inhabitants “just a little bit”.

<h1>Unique Solutions</h1>

<aside class="notes">
There are always downsides to every idea, but I propose two solutions to losing reliance on pesticides: Using a mesh around farms to block pests The problem would be inaccessible for natural pollinators and the farmers themselves. Using sticky traps and natural herbicides (vinegar which is too acidic, kills weeds).

<h1>Optimistic Future</h1>

<aside class="notes">
The pesticide issue, since the release of Rachel Carson’s “Silent Spring”, has gotten better. Many of the worst pesticides have been banned, and new, concentrated pesticides have been implemented to replace the old. These new pesticides take less to do the same work, and take longer to be resisted.
